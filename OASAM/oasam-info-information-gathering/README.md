# ASAM-INFO: Information Gathering


The application information gathering is one of the most important parts in Android application assessments. At this stage, the attack surface is defined, provoking that many vulnerabilitycases that will be defined by the controls in the following sections will be tested thanks to the information gathered in this section.

The following controls are applied in this section:


**[OASAM-INFO-001](https://github.com/b66l/OASAM/blob/master/oasam-info-information-gathering/oasam-info-001-general-information.md)**: General Information. List of general application data

**[OASAM-INFO-002](https://github.com/b66l/OASAM/blob/master/oasam-info-information-gathering/oasam-info-002-components-list.md)**: Components list. List of application components.

**[OASAM-INFO-003](https://github.com/b66l/OASAM/blob/master/oasam-info-information-gathering/oasam-info-003-component-permissions.md)**: Component permissions. List of application component permissions.

**[OASAM-INFO-004](https://github.com/b66l/OASAM/blob/master/oasam-info-information-gathering/oasam-info-004-components-exported.md)**: Components exported.

**[OASAM-INFO-005](https://github.com/b66l/OASAM/blob/master/oasam-info-information-gathering/oasam-info-005-component-launch-intents.md)**: Component Launching Intents. List of component launching intents.
