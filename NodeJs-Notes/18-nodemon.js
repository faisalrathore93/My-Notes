Nodemon
=======

is an nodejs package which allows us to see real time changes in code directly in the appilication. so we don't need to 
resrtat out app everytime we change the code.

$apt install npm
$npm install nodemon -g                   ---       -g stands for globally
$nodemon app.js                           ---        starts app.js with nodemon
